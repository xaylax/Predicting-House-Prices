# Predicting-House-Prices

Used TensorFlow, keras, sci-kit learn, pandas and a neural network architecture to predict house prices from a dataset.

Learned about callbacks, splitting test data, neural network architecture and layering, data isolation and the adam optimization function

This is my very first Machine Learning project, looking forward to see where it takes me!
